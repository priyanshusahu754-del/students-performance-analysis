# 🎓 Students Performance Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## 📌 Project Overview

### This project presents a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Students Performance Dataset.
The objective of this analysis is to identify the major factors that influence student academic performance in subjects such as Math, Reading, and Writing.

### The project focuses on understanding how demographic, socio-economic, parental background, and preparation-related factors affect students' overall academic success.

### This is my second independent EDA project, completed entirely on my own to strengthen my practical understanding of:

- Data Cleaning
- data Visualization
- Statistical Insights
- Feature Engineering
- Correlation Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis Techniques
- 📂 Dataset Information

## The dataset contains information about students along with their academic scores and background details.

### Features Included:
- Feature	Description
- gender	Gender of the student
- race/ethnicity	Demographic group of the student
- parental level of education	Parents’ education qualification
- lunch	Type of lunch (standard or free/reduced)
- test preparation course	Whether the student completed the preparation course
- math score	Math exam score
- reading score	Reading exam score
- writing score	Writing exam score
## 🎯 Objectives of the Analysis

### The primary goals of this project were:

- To understand factors affecting student performance
- To identify relationships between different features
- To discover hidden patterns in academic scores
- To analyze the impact of preparation and socio-economic background
- To perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
- To generate meaningful insights using visualizations
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
# 📊 Analysis Performed
- ✅ Data Cleaning
- Checked missing values
- Checked duplicate records
- Verified data consistency
- ✅ Feature Engineering

## Created new features such as:

Average Score
average_score = (
    math score +
    reading score +
    writing score
) / 3

## Performance Category

### Students were categorized into:

- Excellent
- Good
- Average
- Poor

# 📈 Types of Analysis Performed
## 1. Univariate Analysis

- Analyzed individual features independently using:

- Parent education distribution
- Subject score distributions

## 2. Bivariate Analysis

Studied relationships between two variables using:

- Barplots
- Scatterplots
- Boxplots
- Examples:
- Gender vs Average Score
- Test Preparation vs Average Score
- Lunch vs Student Performance
- Parental Education vs Performance

## 3. Multivariate Analysis

Performed advanced analysis combining multiple features together.

- Examples:
- Gender + Test Preparation + Average Score
-Lunch + Gender + Preparation vs Performance
- Correlation Heatmap
- Subject-wise Performance Analysis
## 🔥 Key Findings
## ✅ Test Preparation Course Has the Highest Impact

Students who completed the test preparation course performed significantly better in all subjects.

## ✅ Socio-Economic Condition Affects Performance

- Students with standard lunch generally scored higher compared to students with free/reduced lunch.

- This indicates the impact of financial background on education.

## ✅ Parental Education Influences Student Success

- Students whose parents had higher education qualifications generally performed better academically.

## ✅ Female Students Performed Better Overall

- Female students showed more consistent and balanced performance, especially in:

- Reading
- Writing

Male students performed slightly better in Math.

## Reading and Writing Scores Are Strongly Correlated

Students with strong reading skills usually also had strong writing skills.

📌 Most Important Features Affecting Performance

## Based on the analysis, the most influential factors were:

- Test Preparation Course
- Lunch Type (Economic Background)
- Parental Level of Education
- Gender
- Reading/Writing Relationship
- 📊 Important Visualizations

## The project includes several visualizations such as:
- Countplots
- Histograms
- Boxplots
- Grouped Barplots
- Scatterplots
- Correlation Heatmaps
- Multivariate Catplots

## These visualizations helped uncover meaningful relationships between features and student performance.

## 📚 What I Learned From This Project

Through this project, I improved my understanding of:

- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Correlation analysis
- Data storytelling
-Visualization techniques
- Real-world interpretation of data
- EDA workflow and analytical thinking
  ## 🚀 Final Conclusion

This analysis clearly shows that student performance is not determined by intelligence alone.

Academic success is strongly influenced by:

- Preparation
Financial condition
-kFamily educational background
- Support system
- Learning environment

## Students who:

- completed test preparation,
- belonged to financially stable backgrounds,
- and received better educational guidance at home

generally performed significantly better.

This project highlights how data analysis can uncover meaningful insights and help us better understand real-world educational patterns.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Possible future enhancements:
- 0Machine Learning model for performance prediction
- Student clustering analysis
- Feature importance analysis
- Interactive dashboard creation
- Predictive analytics using classification algorithms
